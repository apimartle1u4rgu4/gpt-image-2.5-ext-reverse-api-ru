**Why teams call GPT Image 2.5 (`gpt-image-2.5-ext`) through APIMart**

- **One key, entire catalog.** The same `https://api.apimart.ai/v1` base URL and `Authorization` header reach GPT Image 2.5 (`gpt-image-2.5-ext`) and 300+ other image, video and language models — switch the `model` field, not your client.
- **$1 minimum, pay as you go.** No subscription and no prepaid plan to size up front: top up from $1 and spend it on calls.
- **The charge comes back in the response.** Every completed task reports the amount billed (`cost` / `credits_cost`); a task marked `failed` is refunded.
- **Async by design.** Submit, take the `task_id`, poll `GET /v1/tasks/{id}` — batching and retries are ordinary queue work, not a bespoke integration.

GPT Image 2.5 is OpenAI's image model on the flare and sunburst routes, priced per delivered image by resolution.

## Model id and routes

| Route | `model` value | Billing | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Per-image | `gpt-image-2.5-ext` | per delivered image, by resolution | see the [model page](https://go.apimart.ai/k-bfc28a) for the exact tiers |

Endpoint: `POST https://api.apimart.ai/v1/images/generations` (OpenAI-compatible), then poll `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}`.

## Pricing

<!-- pricing:model:start -->
| Output | List price | Effective price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default | $0.0375 | $0.03 |
| 4K | $0.05 | $0.04 |

The token-billed official route bills per million tokens instead: `text_input` $1.60, `cached_text_input` free, `image_input` $1.60, `cached_image_input` free, `text_output` $9.60, `image_output` $96.00.

Prices are a snapshot; the [pricing page](https://go.apimart.ai/k-e71d86) and [`data/model.json`](data/model.json) are refreshed by CI, and a completed task reports the exact amount in its `cost` field.

## Request parameters

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | string | required | the model id shown in the route table above |
| `prompt` | string | required | what to generate, or what to change when editing |
| `size` | string | `auto` / `1:1` | aspect ratio, or `auto` where the route supports it |
| `resolution` | string | `1K` | output resolution tier — cost scales with it |
| `n` | integer | `1` | number of images per task, where the route allows more than one |
| `image_urls` | string[] | — | reference images as public HTTP(S) URLs or base64 data URLs |
| `nsfw_check` | boolean | `false` | runs `omni-moderation-latest` before submitting |

The table lists the fields accepted by the APIMart OpenAI-compatible image endpoint. Check the [model page](https://go.apimart.ai/k-bfc28a) for anything this model adds on top.

## Quickstart

```bash
curl --request POST --url https://api.apimart.ai/v1/images/generations \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $APIMART_API_KEY" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-image-2.5-ext","prompt":"A bamboo forest at sunrise, slow push-in","size":"1:1","resolution":"1K"}'
```

```python
import os, time, requests

BASE = "https://api.apimart.ai/v1"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['APIMART_API_KEY']}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

created = requests.post(f"{BASE}/images/generations", headers=HEADERS, timeout=60, json={
    "model": "gpt-image-2.5-ext", "prompt": "A bamboo forest at sunrise, slow push-in",
}).json()
task_id = created["data"]["id"]

while True:
    task = requests.get(f"{BASE}/tasks/{task_id}", headers=HEADERS, timeout=60).json()["data"]
    if task["status"] in ("completed", "failed"):
        break
    time.sleep(5)
print(task.get("cost"), task["result"]["images"][0]["url"])
```

Runnable versions: [`examples/`](examples). The task lifecycle is `pending → processing → completed | failed`.

## FAQ

**What is the GPT Image 2.5 model id?**
